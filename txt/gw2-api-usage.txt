Usage
Authentication
Primary article: API:API key
Most endpoints return general results about game data and so do not require authentication.

The endpoints that can be used to return specific user or guild data require authentication via an API key in one of two ways.

Authorization request header: Authorization: Bearer [api key]
access_token query parameter: ?access_token=[api key]
As most browsers prevent CORS, the request header method will only be possible via custom applications. If using a browser, use a query parameter. Additionally, preflight requests are not supported by the API backend.

Schema Versions
Primary article: API:2#Schemas
Selected version 2 endpoints support different schema versions as a way to introduce changes in the returned data without breaking applications.

The schema version can be supplied by using the v=<schema> query parameter.
