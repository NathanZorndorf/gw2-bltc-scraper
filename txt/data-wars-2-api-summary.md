## Field Calculations
All price and value fields are stored in copper (the smallest GW2 currency unit). To display as gold/silver/copper, use:

```js
gold = Math.floor(price / 10000)
silver = Math.floor((price % 10000) / 100)
copper = price % 100
```

## How Data Is Aggregated
- Data is collected from in-game listings and transactions.
- For each hour, all relevant buy/sell listings are processed.
- Statistical fields (min, max, avg, stdev) are calculated from arrays of prices/quantities.
- Listed, delisted, and sold counts are determined by comparing changes in quantities between time intervals.
